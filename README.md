# LeaveAllSubreddits

This program uses the reddits client and developer tools to allow the redditor to leave all subreddits at once. 
In order to use this program you will need to create an app at https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps.

     Name: Leave All Subs
     
     pick script for personal use
     
     Description: put whatever you want
     
     redirect uri: http://localhost:8000
     
     Everything else I left blank.

Once you have made your app. Click edit to see more details on it.
     
     Under 'personal user script' you will see your Client ID
     
     Beside 'secret' your Client Secret

In the python file all you need to do it replace the "INSERT ..." with your information.
Run the file in the command line or which ever system you use.

If you do not immediately see all your subreddits gone from your account, give it 24hrs to process.
